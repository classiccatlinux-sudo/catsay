# catsay
a cowsay like program made by classic14

# how to use
1. linux use the x86_64 executeable

2. windows idk coming soon :D

3. mac... :D

# notes
the python3 code file: catsay.py IS fully open source under the GPL 3.0 licence
the x86_executeable is NOT under the GPL 3.0 licence as you can NOT see the code but it is just the catsay.py file 
but compiled as a x86_64 executable

this program was made in 100% python3 code by classic14 
i am the maker of this program and owner of all files but as the GPL 3.0 licence states you may edit the file and re-publish it as your own 
AS long as you say i made the first program and you put: basd off catsay in your DEC

this is not based off cowsay but its the same idea with a cat yes this is a "rip off" but come on its just to be funny :)
